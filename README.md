# Solution-Challenge-Pet-Care
Hunger is a viable problem to stray animals as well, especially because of lockdowns during Covid-19. During the pandemic, a lot of stray animals around our neighbourhood was underfed. As much as we try to fill the water and food cups around our houses, a lot of us was unable to spot other feeding stations that those animals were used to feed. That number got drastically high in industrial cities where people could not give attention to feeding cups on a daily basis. Especially around Europe, thousands of stray animals face starvation.

#Our Solution
PetCare tracks the nearest feeding stations and their last feed date. We also record the animals in need, whether they need to be checked during time to see if they got any better or to highlight the animals that needs urgent care in times where the people found them has no opportunity to help at that time. 

When you want to feed them instead of dropping leftover foods near a garbage, you can check the nearest feeding station and it's last fed time to equally distribute the food among animals. We notify users about feeding stations when they remained unfed for a while and also gather information about the approximate number of animals that's been feeding there to know how long that station could stay after the last feeding time.
